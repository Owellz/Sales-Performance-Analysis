# Sales-Performance-Analysis
I decided to analyze the sales performance of these data by using Spreadsheet and Power BI to explore the whole data structure. First, I imported the data on my excel worksheet, then I started by cleaning the data using TRIM and ROUNDUP functions to remove spaces between MANAGER's names, and ROUNDUP the PRICE values to zero decimal places.
Thereafter, I exported the data to POWER BI for visual analysis where THE TOTAL REVENUE WAS DETERMINED, THE BEST SELLING PRODUCT WAS SPOTTED, AND THE REVENUE BREAKDOWN BY PRODUCT METHOD. A visual representation of the result is attached to the repo folder.
