# Sales-Performance-Analysis
I decided to analyze the sales performance of these data by using Spreadsheet and Power BI to explore the whole data structure. First, I imported the data on my excel worksheet, then I started by cleaning the data using TRIM and ROUNDUP functions to remove spaces between MANAGER's names, and ROUNDUP the PRICE values to zero decimal places.
Thereafter, I exported the data to POWER BI for visual analysis where THE TOTAL REVENUE WAS DETERMINED, THE BEST SELLING PRODUCT WAS SPOTTED, AND THE REVENUE BREAKDOWN BY PRODUCT METHOD. A visual representation of the result is attached to the repo folder.

-- From the Sales Data import on the Power BI, I was able to TRANSFORM;
----First by, ROUNDUP the PRICE values to a whole number, same for the REVENUE.
--- The REVENUE was CALCULATED by multiplying The PRICE values with the QUANTITY values respectively.
---- Also, I IMPORTED Countries' dependencies on CAPITALs (Lisbon, Madrid, London, etc
---- I used the MERGE function to achieve this, thereby sorting and merging each respective country's dependencies)


Data Analysis Questions

1) What is our best-selling product?

The above questions were VISUALIZED USING POWER BI to ANSWER the QUESTIONS.
